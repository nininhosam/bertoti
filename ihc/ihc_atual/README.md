# About
Using the article [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) as a base, here are a couple of examples of bad and good uses of heuristics.

## Heuristics examples

### Example 1: "Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors" 
For the first mistake, we're gonna take a look at heuristic #9. It states that
users should understand what's wrong, and no error codes should be shown to them,  but instead 
be clear about the error, and offer solutions.

Twitter, for example, shows you a "This page doesn't exist" error when you try to access a tweet that you
don't have access to (for example, if you're not logged in, and try to view a tweet with "explicit/sensitive content")
Not only does it not tell you _why_ the error happened, it also does not offer you to log in to view, instead guiding you to "search for something else".

### Example 2: "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design"
This time, we're looking at heuristic #8, which says that designs should keep important bits in focus, and 
not let unnecessary elements take away the attention of the user. We can see it done _badly_ here, on the SIGA website
where a very important section (the image with information about the topic) is so small it's barely readable, where it should
be at least big enough to earn the attention of the reader.

However, we can also see it done _right_ on the google's homepage, for instance. the instant the webpage loads, the attention of the reader
is immediately focused on the huge logo and search bar, which are the main features and probably what the user is looking for.
There are no elements to distract or divert one's attention, and the few elements that do exist, each serve their purposes, either divulging
information (the footer) or providing access to extra options (top right buttons). without clogging the screen.

### Example 3: "Consistency and Standards"
This concept is simple, Heuristic #4 is basically following standards set by your own product, and other people's product. therefore, it
can be expressed by using industry convetions, which is exemplified by spotify in this image, where you can access your settings
(both for the app, account and profile) on the top right corner, which is an industry standard, and the user might already be used to.

### Example 4: "Error Prevention"
Heuristic #5 focuses around preventing the user from doing something they do not desire. may that be accidentally, or by lack of understanding.
this is represented in the image, by how github deals with the deletion of a repository. Firstly, it aks if the user wants to delete it,
that serves to judge the users intent. it then explains what it means to delete a repository, and what the risks are, asking if the
user understands, that serves to confirm the user's awareness on what the action they are about to perform does. and lastly, it then asks the
user to do a _chore_. it asks for an input of the full name of the repository, which is case-sensitive and needs to be _*precisely*_ as displayed.
this last step is the final barrier before removal, and it's purposefully a chore, because it serves to prevent the user from confirming "accidentally".
instead of a confirm button, the user needs to be fully intent on deleting to type out the name of the repository, thus after these 3 barriers, and only
after them, can this action take place.
